## Week 0 boost

Week 0 of the boost begins on star wars day (May 4th). I told myself that I will be taking this year's boost seriously and commit myself to all of the weeks. I started on 2021's boost last year and made it to day 11 and gave up. I got busy in real life and became too lazy to pick back up. Hopefully this year will be different and it is already because I'm going to write down notes in some form of Zettelkasten which I learned about on week 1's boost.

This will be my own version of notes of writing down my progress, thoughts, references, etc. so I can go back and review. Maybe this will help me commit to this boost the whole way.

This is a bit late on the notes but I am going back to week 0 VOD and summarized what happened
Here we go...

* Be an autodidactic - learn things in your way, set a plan and own your learning. Learn how to research and get info fast. 
* RWX method - Read/Research . Write down. Execute.

Aaron Swartz documentary. Watched it on Saturday night. Grabbed the one that was refenced on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vz06QO3UkQ
Very good documentary and sad too...

Installed Virtual Box on my machine ready to go. https://www.virtualbox.org/

Missing Semester of your CS education: https://missing.csail.mit.edu/

This is somewhat the extent of it. Left a lot of out because some are simple stuff like requirements and stuff I knew. Also the story time stuff that isn't necessary to jot down.


## Week 1 of boost

We have officially begun!

* Zettelkasten
This is a form of note taking and to jot down info to reference back onto.

I will go back to read through that source. I know rwxrob has setup standards on how to write these. For this boost, I'm going to have one big notes file and jott down notes, thoughts, references, etc.

Real way:
* Title less than 50 characters
* Body of 25-30 lines
* Refences including URLs section after body
* Hashtags on last line after 4-space indent
* User Isosec identifier (those unique ID folders)
* Stick with single level lists

You don't even have to use github for these zets, but I prefer to do it this way because I hate writing. 

* isosec - 20220509202100 - [year][month][day][hour][minute][sec]

* Software licenses - go to tldrlegal.com

* Markdown language - full cheatsheet guide on rwx.gg/lang/md/basic

* Installed Ubuntu server
* Went through VM Virtualbox setup to boot a virtual machine. Have the VM to use Ubuntu and point to the ubuntu server ISO file. 

* Rob talks about comptia A+ certification being important in IT jobs and someone named Professor Messor that goes through that stuff.

* command lines - created a file to list out the cmd line
