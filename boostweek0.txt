## Week 0 boost

Week 0 of the boost begins on star wars day (May 4th). I told myself that I will be taking this year's boost seriously and commit myself to all of the weeks. I started on 2021's boost last year and made it to day 11 and gave up. I got busy in real life and became too lazy to pick back up. Hopefully this year will be different and it is already because I'm going to write down notes in some form of Zettelkasten which I learned about on week 1's boost.

This will be my own version of notes of writing down my progress, thoughts, references, etc. so I can go back and review. Maybe this will help me commit to this boost the whole way.

Also, I am going back to week 0 VOD and summarized what happened
Here we go...

This is somewhat the extent of it. Left a lot of out because some are simple stuff like requirements and stuff I knew. Also the story time stuff that isn't necessary to jot down.
